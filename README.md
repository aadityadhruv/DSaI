A model to detect fake Nintendo DS Cartridges using a neural network. 


The model is aimed to be trained using the various images available on https://www.reddit.com/r/gameverifying/ and the corresponding label which is done by trusted verifiers. 

The model uses inception layers along with a traditional stem layer to extract features from a authentic and counterfeit cartridge.
